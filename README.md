Comp1004 Website

This is my Password Manager SPA.
It allows the user to input their login details into the system
This includes:
- Website Name / URL
- Username / Email assosicated with the website login
- Password connected to this account

Once entered passwords are stored with a key and encrypted using a caesar cypher with unique number of shifts

It also allows the user to the recall their Password by inputting
- Website Name / URL
- Username / Email

In addition to the entry and request of passwords the application also includes a Strength checker wich will rate the strength of your password using a visual gradient from red to green
showing a visual representation of your passwords strength, to help bring light to weak and unsecure passwords aiming to bring users to create stronger passwords

The application also includes a password generator if the user would prefer a randomly generated strong password 8-14 characters long, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters.

Finally to increase usability of the webpage there are clear buttons to clear specific input tables and another large button at the bottom of the page to clear all history if the user wishes.
